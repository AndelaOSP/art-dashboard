# Principles
The given conventions are guidelines, which are not set on stone. This means that the document may be modified regularly to reflect the updated and new best practices adopted by the team.

We are using the airbnb react standards for react styles, with some of the rules overriden to fit our use case.

Always follow the _**SOLID and YAGNI principles**_ when writing code. This is to ensure that our code becomes easier to maintain, extend and update. Fixing a bug in one file should not prompt changes in 5 different files, which doesn't have anything to do with the bug, in order not to break existing functionalities.

**YAGNI** basically means that _"You aren't gonna need it"_. It advocates for adding only the code that you need to implement a feature, not adding a code that you think you will use in the foreseeable future.

**SOLID** stands for:
- **Single Responsibility Principle**
